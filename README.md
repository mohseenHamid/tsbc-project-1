## Usage

Look up a film using the search bar. Movie suggestions will display as you type in a few letters. Select a film from the dropdown menu. A modal will pop up displaying key information about the film such as the runtime, release year and the plot. Cards will also be displayed on the modal of 3 key actors. Select the actor cards to trigger another modal which will display key information about the actor. If you want to store a movie or an actor in the favourites section, select the "Save to Favourites" button on the respective modal. The favourites section on the main page will display your saved movies and actors. Selecting either of the clear favourites buttons on the main page will erase their respective favourites section.
